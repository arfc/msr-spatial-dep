# Overview
These scripts are motivated by the work of Shayan Shahbazi [1].
In general, these scripts give a high-level view of the effects of including a more refined spatial mesh on a traditional depletion simulation.
These scripts assume the existence of two neutronicly distinct regions: in-core and ex-core.
Realistically, there would be a power profile in-core, but this is generally ignored for depletion simulations.
The `morty_pde_ode_compare` script has an option to include a sinusoidal source and loss profile in-core, which alters results by roughly <1%.
These scripts assume a ratio of 33% in-core and 67% ex-core.

# `morty_pde_ode_compare.py`
This script offers a comparison between a depletion ODE (in time only) and a depletion PDE (1D in space and in time).

# `isobar_morty_pde.py`
This script includes an example 135-isobar PDE-MORTY solve for the MSRE.
