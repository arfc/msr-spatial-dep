    "\n",
    "In order to reduce computational cost, the MORTY PDE approach looks only at isobars and without the advection loosely coupled to depletion.\n",
    "The loose depletion coupling means that the terms in the equation can be updated as frequently or infrequently as desired. The problem can be run even without a depletion step (though it may be easier to run with depletion).\n",
    "OpenMC can generate and output the relevant production and loss rates after a depletion step, which can then be fed into the MORTY PDE solver.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Approach - PDE Homogeneous Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes the depletion matrix for each material and uses that in the finite differencing format previously described. This approach will initially be a homogeneous approach, where the depletion matrix will be assumed constant over that entire spatial region. In theory, it is possible to use the transfer rates dictionary to reconstruct a flow path and then approximate how materials fit together to have a more accurate representation of the problem spatially. However, that approach will not be used here.\n",

    "2. Determine time sub-step based on $\\lambda_k$ of 0.9 (specific value needs testing), flow rates, number of spatial nodes, and spatial dimensions provided\n",
    "3. Step through each time step, and within each time step solve spatially\n",
    "4. Iterate until the time has reached $h$, or the depletion time step (if the sub-step will be too large, use a smaller value)\n",
